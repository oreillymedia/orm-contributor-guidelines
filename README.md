# O'Reilly Atlas Contributor Guidelines 

If you're considering making a contribution to an O'Reilly content projects, here are some guidelines to keep in mind. 

## You must have a valid Atlas account.

You must register in [O'Reilly Atlas](https://atlas.oreilly.com/) in order for us to accept your contribution.  When you sign up for an account, you grant O'Reilly a nonexclusive license from you of the rights needed for O'Reilly use, publish and distribute your contributed content, and confirms that you retain ownership of the copyright in your contributions.

## Submit only your own work.

You warrant that all work that you contribute is your original work, except for material that is in the public domain or for which you have obtained permission. Feel free to draw from your own existing work (blogs, articles, talks, etc.), so long as you are happy with granting O'Reilly a nonexclusive license.

## Your submission may not be accepted.

Be aware that we may not be able to accept your contribution.  Acceptance of any contribution is at the sole discretion of the project's authorial and editorial team.

## Volunteers only.

Contributions are made on a volunteer basis — in other words, contributors are not paid for their contributions.

## Only submit a pull request when you consider your work complete.

Please note that if you make a contribution via GitHub, you will need to merge it into an Atlas project so that it can be accepted.  Please see the [Atlas documentation](http://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/) for details on how to keep your [Atlas project in sync with GitHub](http://docs.atlas.oreilly.com/ch09.html#atlas-git).

## Check spelling and formatting.

Such checking seems obvious part, but it is worth a reminder — sometimes it seems that it is honored more in the breach than in the observance.
